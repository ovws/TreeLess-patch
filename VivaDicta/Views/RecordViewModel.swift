/// View model managing audio recording, transcription, and enhancement workflow.
///
/// `RecordViewModel` handles the complete lifecycle of voice recording, from capturing
/// audio to transcribing and optionally enhancing the text. It coordinates with
/// ``TranscriptionManager`` and ``AIService`` through the ``AppState``.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The view model manages:
/// - Audio recording via AVAudioRecorder or AudioPrewarmManager (for keyboard flow)
/// - Recording state machine (idle, recording, transcribing, enhancing, error)
/// - Audio level monitoring for visualization
/// - Transcription and AI processing pipeline
/// - Communication with keyboard extension via ``AppGroupCoordinator``
///
/// ## Recording States
///
/// ```
/// idle → recording → transcribing → enhancing → idle
///                  ↘                          ↗
///                    → error → idle (on cancel)
/// ```
///
/// ## Keyboard Integration
///
/// When the keyboard extension activates a session, recording uses a prewarmed
/// audio engine for lower latency. The view model handles start/stop/cancel
/// commands from the keyboard via Darwin notifications.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let viewModel = RecordViewModel(appState: appState, modelContainer: container)
///
/// // Start recording
/// viewModel.startCaptureAudio()
///
/// // Stop and transcribe
/// viewModel.stopCaptureAudio(modelContext: context)
///
/// // Cancel processing
/// viewModel.cancelProcessing()
/// ```
